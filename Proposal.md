Zeno AI Knowledge Management MVP
Project Proposal
Prepared for: Zeno Group 
Prepared by: Brilliant Noise 
Date: May 22, 2025

1. Executive Summary
Zeno Group is rapidly scaling its AI capabilities and requires a means of improving AI knowledge curation, sharing, and, specifically, usage of GPT/AI tools within the organization. Following briefing, this proposal outlines how we will deliver a ‘sprint’ to create a practical, user focussed knowledge management system with implementation by end June 2025.
The system will be designed to improve the organization of tools by function aligned to existing knowledge sharing and communications channels. This will mean integrating with how the Zeno team currently share AI documentation and GPT interfaces across Sharepoint and MS Teams to provide accessible and practical improvements. The intention is to provide fast improvements and establish a Knowledge Management MVP that becomes a building block of Zeno's strengthened AI operating model by combining a robust structure with intuitive design that delivers immediate value. 
2. Our Approach
We will implement a product sprint methodology focused on:
User-centric design around a clear product vision and user stories
Editorial simplicity rather than complex system implementation
Practical guidance 
Intuitive navigation  
Clear Zeno ownership separate from Edelman's internal GPT page.
The Knowledge Management MVP will:
Establish a centralized, searchable home for high-value GPTs aligned to user needs and use cases
Define a governance architecture for scalable knowledge sharing
Promote cross-team collaboration, knowledge sharing and AI learning to accelerate productivity gains. 
3. Knowledge Management MVP Components
Our MVP will include four integrated components:
Custom GPT
Comprehensive manual of tasks with GPT automation
Embedded guide for easier information access
Foundation toolkit  with specialized tools for advanced users
Improved Tool Taxonomy
Structured naming and tagging system to support findability aligned to use cases
AI tools categorized by function e.g.:
Media list creation
Media landscape analysis
Stakeholder insights 
Strategy planning
Executive brand voice development
Documentation & Training
Searchable documentation in Word/PDF format
Tutorial Loom-style screenshare video for async onboarding
Guidance on tool selection and use cases
Communications and Engagement 
Dedicated MS Teams channel for a) sharing updates b) promoting knowledge sharing c) celebrating success d) answering questions 
Weekly newsletter cross promoted via MS Teams to showcase different components
Feedback from both the MS Teams channel and weekly newsletter used for continuous improvement and evolution of MVP.
4. Project Structure
To maximise impact, we will deliver the Knowledge Management MVP in a 15-day sprint across four phases:
Phase 1: Discovery & Design 

(3 days) 
Outcome: Definition of priority use cases (Zeno and for client delivery), taxonomy, communication framework


Phase 2: Content Creation 
(5 days)
Outcome: Custom GPT prompt build, documentation, tutorials
Phase 3: Implementation 
(4 days)
Outcome: Teams setup, GPT deployment, launch communications
Phase 4: Testing & Refinement 
(3 days)
Outcome: User feedback, prompt adjustments, QA

6. Client Inputs
For the project to be delivered against scope and within timings, we'll need:
A dedicated Zeno team member as primary point of contact and for approvals throughout 
A Zeno team member assigned to lead ongoing communications (post launch)
Access to existing Zeno GPTs, guidance, and file locations
Key contacts for IT, security and platform admin
Time with 3-4 active GPT users to understand use cases and access. 


7. Commercial Terms
Investment
The project will be delivered by a blended team of senior and mid-level resource at Brilliant Noise. Deliverables and activity will be aligned to the broader Zeno - Brilliant Noise AI project to achieve efficiencies. 
Based on the above proposal to deliver the Knowledge Management MVP, the project fee would be: £19,950, converted to USD $25,935. 
Payment Schedule 
Project Kickoff: 50% (£9,975) - Upon approval 
Final Delivery: 30% (£9,975) - June 24, 2025
Timeline
Project kickoff: June 2, 2025
Sprint execution: June 2-21, 2025
Final delivery: June 24, 2025
8. Next Steps
On agreement of the proposal, we’d suggest a call to:
Agree scope of work and immediate timings
Set up introductions with internal contacts including for access to knowledge sharing platforms and potential case study users 
Agree included GPTs and target users.
