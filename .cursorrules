# Zeno KB Cursor Rules

## Development Server Rules

- **ALWAYS** use `./dev.sh` to start the development server, NOT `pnpm dev` directly
- The project structure is: root/zeno_kb/ contains z_1/ which is the Next.js app
- When running commands that need to be in z_1 directory, use `cd z_1 && [command]`
- The dev.sh script handles navigation to z_1 automatically

## Directory Structure

- Root: `/Users/jasonryan/Documents/zeno_kb/`
- Next.js App: `/Users/jasonryan/Documents/zeno_kb/z_1/`
- Always check current directory before running commands

## Style Management Rules

- Use `pnpm audit:styles` (from z_1 directory) to check style violations
- All custom classes must use `zeno-` prefix
- Dynamic Tailwind classes must be added to safelist in tailwind.config.ts
- When making CSS changes, restart dev server to see changes

## Never Do These Things

- Never run `pnpm dev` from the root zeno_kb directory
- Never assume terminal commands work without checking the current directory
- Never forget that the user gets upset when I make directory mistakes repeatedly
