Define theme tokens:

  "primaryColor": "#04BB63",
  "textColor": "#000000",
  "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",
  "altBackground": "#F5F5F5",
  "fontFamily": "Helios Antique, sans-serif"

Avoid serif fonts ‚Äì the brand language is confident, clean, and modern


Prioritise white space and structure ‚Äì the layout should feel editorial, not cluttered
