# Demo Script: Zeno AI Knowledge Management MVP

---

**Hook:**
Imagine if every Zeno team member could instantly find the perfect AI tool, best practice, or expert guide—right inside MS Teams. No more wasted time, no more guesswork—just smarter, faster work.

**Live Flow:**
Let's dive in. Here's the Zeno AI Knowledge Hub dashboard. Right away, you're greeted with a bold, welcoming headline and a search bar. Let's say I need to automate a client report. I type "report automation" and instantly see a curated list of AI tools, each with a clear description and user ratings.

I click on the top tool. Here, I find step-by-step instructions, a short video tutorial, and real feedback from colleagues. If I'm new, there's an onboarding checklist and beginner guides just a click away. Need help? The feedback tab lets me ask a question or suggest a new tool—no barriers, just support.

**Wow Moment:**
Now, watch this: I favorite the tool, and it's added to my personal dashboard for one-click access next time. I leave feedback, and within a week, I see my suggestion reflected in the next update—proof that this platform evolves with its users. All of this happens without ever leaving MS Teams or SharePoint.
