# Product Manifesto: Zeno AI Knowledge Management MVP

**Problem:**  
As Zeno Group rapidly scales its AI capabilities, knowledge about AI tools, best practices, and use cases is scattered across platforms and teams. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, duplicated efforts, and missed opportunities for collaboration and learning. There is no centralized, user-friendly system for curating, sharing, and evolving AI knowledge within the organization.

**Audience:**  
- Zeno Group employees, especially those using or exploring AI/GPT tools  
- AI champions and power users  
- Team leads and project managers  
- IT, security, and platform administrators  
- New joiners seeking onboarding and best practices

**Solution:**  
The Zeno AI Knowledge Management MVP is a centralized, intuitive platform that organizes, curates, and democratizes access to high-value AI tools, documentation, and best practices. It integrates with existing channels like SharePoint and MS Teams, features a robust taxonomy, searchable documentation, embedded guides, and a toolkit for advanced users. The MVP is delivered via a focused sprint, ensuring rapid, user-centric deployment and immediate value.

**Magic Moment:**  
A Zeno team member, searching for the best way to automate a client report, finds a curated GPT tool, complete with step-by-step documentation and a Loom-style tutorial, all within seconds—right from their familiar MS Teams channel. They use it, share feedback, and see their input reflected in the next week's update, feeling empowered and heard.

**Why Excited:**  
This MVP isn't just a repository—it's the foundation for a culture of AI-powered collaboration and continuous learning at Zeno. It bridges silos, accelerates productivity, and makes every team member a contributor to Zeno's AI journey. By focusing on editorial simplicity, user needs, and rapid iteration, we're building a living system that grows with the organization and delivers real, measurable impact from day one.
