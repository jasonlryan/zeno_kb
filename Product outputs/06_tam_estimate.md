# Total Addressable Market (TAM) Estimate

**Market Defined:** Enterprise AI Knowledge Management Platforms for mid- to large-size organizations (≥500 employees) worldwide.

---

## Assumptions
1. **Number of target organizations:** Approximately 30,000 enterprises globally have ≥500 employees (source: OECD / World Bank enterprise data).
2. **Adoption rate per organization:** We assume 20 % of employees in these organizations will require access to an AI knowledge management platform (knowledge workers, managers, AI champions).  
   • **Average headcount per organization:** 1,000 employees.  
   • **Seats per organization:** 20 % × 1,000 = **200 seats**.
3. **Average annual price per seat:** $15 per user per month → **$180 per user per year** (comparable to SaaS KM tools with AI add-ons).
4. All figures are in **USD** and represent annual recurring revenue (ARR).

---

## Equation
TAM = (Number of organizations) × (Seats per organization) × (Annual price per seat)

\[
\text{TAM} = 30{,}000 \times 200 \times \$180
\]

---

## Calculation
30,000 × 200 = **6,000,000 seats**  
6,000,000 seats × $180 = **$1,080,000,000**

---

## TAM Result
**≈ $1.08 Billion (ARR)**

## Sensitivity Check
| Scenario | Orgs | Seats/Org | Price/Seat/Year | TAM (USD) |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Conservative | 25,000 | 150 | $150 | $562.5 M |
| Base (above) | 30,000 | 200 | $180 | $1.08 B |
| Optimistic | 35,000 | 250 | $200 | $1.75 B |

This suggests a robust billion-dollar market opportunity for specialized AI knowledge management solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise collaboration stacks (e.g., Microsoft 365), leaving room for differentiated offerings like the Zeno AI Knowledge Management platform to capture significant value.
