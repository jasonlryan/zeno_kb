## üîç **AI Hive Prompts - Existing Asset Analysis**

### **Question:**

Is `AI Hive Prompts.pdf` an exact match with the existing "AI Hive Prompts" asset in the knowledge base?

### **Existing Asset Details:**

```json
{
  "id": "ai-hive-prompts",
  "title": "AI Hive Prompts",
  "description": "A list of prompts that can be used with the AI Hive or any custom GPT.",
  "type": "Doc",
  "tier": "Foundation",
  "complexity": "Intermediate",
  "tags": ["ai", "word-doc"],
  "function": "Analysis & Research",
  "link": "https://djeholdingsdrive-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/michael_brito_zenogroup_com/EbIO6zjUqnpPs_nwRtz1VwgB2k0HkB2GflrE_pXJxXKSGg?e=CaJCht"
}
```

### **Key Differences Identified:**

| Aspect       | Existing Asset                   | Local PDF                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Format**   | Word document (.docx)            | PDF document (.pdf)             |
| **Location** | SharePoint cloud hosting         | Local file in `z_1/data/`       |
| **Tags**     | `["ai", "word-doc"]`             | Would need `["ai", "pdf"]`      |
| **Access**   | Requires SharePoint login        | Direct browser access           |
| **Content**  | Unknown (need SharePoint access) | Unknown (need content analysis) |

### **Decision Made:**

**SKIPPED** - The PDF was not added to avoid potential duplication. The existing SharePoint Word document serves the same purpose and is already accessible to users.

## üîÆ **Future Considerations**

### **Questions for Review:**

1. **Content Verification**: Should we compare the AI Hive Prompts PDF content with the SharePoint Word document to confirm they contain identical information?

2. **Format Preference**: Do users prefer PDF format for offline access over SharePoint-hosted Word documents?

3. **Accessibility**: Are there users who cannot access SharePoint but could benefit from local PDF versions?

4. **Maintenance**: How do we ensure PDF content stays current compared to cloud-hosted documents that may be updated more frequently?

### **Potential Actions:**

- [ ] **Audit existing SharePoint links** to ensure they're still accessible
- [ ] **Consider PDF alternatives** for SharePoint documents with access issues
- [ ] **Establish content update protocol** for local PDF assets
- [ ] **User feedback collection** on format preferences
