# Reasoning Models: What they are and when to use them

Reasoning models (like ChatGPT's o-series) are designed to tackle complex, multi-step tasks by carefully thinking through the details before responding. This makes them different from standard GPT models, which are faster and better suited to simpler, clearly-defined tasks.

Knowing about reasoning models matters because they can reliably handle challenging scenarios that typically require human-like logic and judgmentâ€”perfect for tasks involving strategic planning, detailed data analysis, or complex problem-solving.

By diving into these resources, you'll learn when and how to use reasoning models effectively, see examples of their strengths, and gain practical tips for integrating them into your work alongside faster GPT models.

**Key Points:**
- Reasoning models work through problems step by step, refining answers as they go, making them more explainable and reliable for complex tasks.
- Use standard models for fast, data-driven tasks; use reasoning models for logic, explanation, or deep analysis.
- Expect reasoning models to be slower, but smarter and more trustworthy for multi-step or strategic work.
