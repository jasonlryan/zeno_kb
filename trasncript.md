Michael Brito (Britopian) 0:04  
Hmm, I'm I Think

Antony Mayfield 1:56  
Hello, Hey, guys, how you doing?

Thomas Bunn 1:59  
Oops, sorry, good. How are you

Antony Mayfield 2:03  
very well, oops. You do whiteboarding. Oh,

Speaker 0 2:07  
this has been your winning York Office. Today we have not been whiteboarding. I'm sure some brilliant persons have been whiteboarding. Oh,

Antony Mayfield 2:14  
yeah, you should. I should get someone in to, like, kind of do a really fascinating whiteboard behind me before I do every call. So it looks like I'm just in mid, mid genius.

Unknown Speaker 2:24  
Well, yeah, of course. I mean, seriously, there's

Antony Mayfield 2:29  
got to be a service in

Speaker 0 2:32  
that we're just complaining that we find that Google meet is so unflattering. So we'll forgive you, but we just, we just think that it just shows all the lines on our face. So what?

Antony Mayfield 2:43  
But, but teams makes you look good, interesting.

Unknown Speaker 2:46  
You can add some filters to team as well,

Antony Mayfield 2:51  
in Google as well. I'm, I'm sorry, I will, we'll do, we'll do a more flattering video service next time you can put like, you know, you can do the apps

Speaker 0 3:02  
audio that's interesting with you. Darcy, if I can merge my audio with yours in Google, let's try it. Oh yeah, look at that. Yeah.

Antony Mayfield 3:14  
See, I've got some lights here. That's looking me. I don't know. I hate Yeah.

Speaker 0 3:22  
You both, yeah, I can hear now it's not see, it's not there's no oh yeah, feedback. That's good, okay, wow, that's why I use team. We discovered something amazing. Well, this, bring, this, bring. I mean,

Antony Mayfield 3:35  
I know you guys got an agenda, but like, this brings us, me on to quite a key point about knowledge sharing, which is, I understand that Google is one of your clients, and like many of the best ways for knowledge sharing that aren't expensive, systems are already in Google, so things like notebook LM and Google Docs and stuff. So I just wanted to mention that because I kind of or I wanted to understand the tension between you're a Microsoft organisation, but you've got Google as a client. So

Speaker 0 4:03  
elements biggest clients there as well. That's why, that's why Google, we have a whole separate like assembly within element is like a whole agency with an agency that's 100% dedicated to Microsoft. So we have this constant push and call, which is hilarious. So anyway, so I want to be drawn because as him and I were connecting, this actually came to light through this New York AI activity during this month in May, over the fourth month of June. Sorry, so they're kicking off their kind of like aI kind of playground month. I think they're calling it SQ name. And obviously the kick off with your your webinar next week for them. And then they've got various activities you want to do the you want to do the AI leadership training later in the month as well, which is all great. And part of that we were like uncovering, just like the New York region is, or the East Coast is, really trying to, like, get organised with, with kind of just repository for all the good AI use cases and stuff. And obviously, something that we've been talking about as, you know, overall. But I just said to Brito, can you intercept that conversation and let's chat with Antony. Can you have been talking about it kind of in earlier we talked about, you know, partnering together to think through, like, how we might just kind of advance that. I wanted to show you, what would you do, and I want to show you the our screen share, and I'll show you the DJ AI one. I find it really hard to navigate, and I actually click to actually get like, prompt. I can't find anything. I don't even think me there. The whole DJ AI thing is very, how can I say it's very teasing. It's like, oh, let's teach genetic PR webinar. Then it's like, but there's no genetic tools at DJ. Just kind of, like, this real like, kind of let me, let me introduce you, and then let me just, like, not give you anything, but I wanted to show you at least what the SharePoint looked like, and then he's got some initial organisation of, like, where we started putting harsh shit so we can, like, start to figure out, like, what could an immediate like, getting organised look like, and then working with you, I think maybe on A more, kind of, like, even smarter way of doing this. I might take us a couple of months, but I said same time, I want to, kind of like, satisfy the the urgency of the agency to at least start have something that people can start to use, that we may just like, up level it at some point. I don't know what the best way is, and we might have thought, I think we need, we need something in there now and then and then go from there. So let me just show you really quickly the, let me show you this.

Michael Brito (Britopian) 6:27  
Well, Thomas pulls that up. Antony, one of the things that that we've been, I mean, it's great. The adoption has been coming along very well. Lot, a lot of, a lot of account people are using gpts. They're creating gpts. And it's, it's kind of like the Wild West, which is good because it's the adoption is happening. And one of the things that I've noticed after I've been involved in we're now quote, unquote, selling the custom GPT. So we're consulting now with account teams, and it's billable revenue for us. And I'm noticing that some of them are not, not just not everybody's talking with us, but a small group of people. And so when I think about knowledge management, and what Thomas just said, you know, I want to make sure that people are doing things the right way. I had an example of somebody saying, hey, it was for a pitch. It was the Xeno West. Someone said, yeah, here, let's use this messaging that I got from chat GPT, and it was just, it was a blanket question, and it was, there was just not a lot of strategic so they're trying it. They're just not, they're taking it as gospel, and they're not best practices. So I think whatever the however we build this knowledge management, I think obviously there should be best practices, but like making sure that people are have access to it easily, without having to, you know, click, click, click, and find and and so that they're they can use it the right way.

Thomas Bunn 7:46  
I think my gut tells me Brito, that it's more like, it's more functions. I think so it's like a media like, like, cools. And then there's like, you know, we might have media monitor between your monitoring stuff, etc. Then there might be like, stretch and planning with audio, and then we have to still keep it like the whole thing is. And I'd love your thoughts. Antony, what worries me a bit, and this is like coming as a strategist, you know, for example, having someone go into this, I go, Oh my god, I hear there's a whole audience insight thing. I'm not even called the strategy planning team, and put a whole audience slides together, but without consulting us to think through, like, what the implications are, et cetera. So there's an element of, like, you have to make it easier to find stuff. It wasn't have to make it hard enough where they're not like, suddenly thinking, I'm going to do like, a full on competitive analysis for a pitch without consulting the Data Intelligence Team, because I could find this really great thing I can use. So it's kind of like finding the middle ground of getting people to feel self sufficient and empowered, but also trying to keep, keep track and control of like, the way people are using stuff, so we don't push people out there to actually experts. It's

Antony Mayfield 8:49  
a case of repeating some like messages around critical thinking, around not accepting about it being the responsibility of the question and not not thinking the machines are genius all of the time. They can be. You just kind of need, we need to include those in any knowledge management again and again. But that actually reminds me, there's a great story this morning, which I will include in the webinar as a cautionary tale. But there was a there's a thing doing the rounds today of like a summer supplement from the Chicago Sun Times, and if you saw that, so that's like things to do in the summer supplement, which is, you know, basically an advertorial type thing in the Chicago times. It's got a list of beach books, and half of them don't exist.

Unknown Speaker 9:38  
Oh, my God, that is because,

Antony Mayfield 9:40  
because the journalist who, I mean, because they were paying peanuts to someone to write a syndicated journalism thing, and they've just like, gone, okay, what are the best books for this summer? And so and then, like, half of them are real. And then it's got books like by Isabel Allende that she never wrote. And

Speaker 0 9:54  
it reminds me of the Ethan Molly book you had us read with the court cases, where the lawyer went in and all these cases to validate. And then the judge was like, when these cases are real, and the judge didn't even realise supposedly that they were and he'd be duped by

Antony Mayfield 10:07  
so it's like, it's not a scare story, like, don't use it. It's a story like, and that journalist, their reaction to it has been, I mean, they're so ashamed, like, they're just like, cannot believe I got caught out. Like, this, hands up, really, really stupid thing to do, but it's like that everyone's done that, like worst, worst mistake in their career, like emailing the salaries to the whole company or or sending out the client's personal email as a press release. Everyone's done something like that. You don't want to do it with this. You don't just don't do it with this. And here's how we want to, you know, it's that kind of thing. Yeah, makes

Speaker 0 10:42  
sense. Actually, this is, this is, can you see the screen? Is it showing it is

Michael Brito (Britopian) 10:52  
complicated to do it in,

Thomas Bunn 10:54  
shared with the cause and infinity mirror. What the hell is that saying? Presenting, though,

Antony Mayfield 10:59  
don't cause an Infinity Mirror. It may rip space time. No, is that

Speaker 0 11:04  
okay? Here we go. Okay, exactly see that, right? Welcome to elements. Ai hub, I can't.

Antony Mayfield 11:11  
No, I'm

Unknown Speaker 11:15  
presenting. It's presenting.

Antony Mayfield 11:17  
Yeah, so sorry.

Thomas Bunn 11:22  
No, you can't. Slight fire up. A

Antony Mayfield 11:25  
teams call maybe it's, I think it might be, oh, that,

Thomas Bunn 11:28  
no, let me try again. Let me just try again. I'm sharing the window, not my full screen or my full screen.

Antony Mayfield 11:34  
Don't worry about the Infinity Mirror. Okay. Screen, okay. The Google engineers just left the Infinity Mirror in there because they're like, Ah, it's hilarious. So

Thomas Bunn 11:45  
she didn't touch screen. Then they didn't, didn't do anything. Did

Michael Brito (Britopian) 11:48  
you click share, Twitter, click share and then share again. Yeah, yeah. The

Antony Mayfield 11:53  
window come up. I

Thomas Bunn 11:55  
know I can't now. There's no, there's no way of, like, look, I I'm position starting, still thinking about, I guess,

Antony Mayfield 12:04  
yeah, I'm sorry.

Thomas Bunn 12:09  
I know he's like, I got 39,000 100 emails in my inbox. Wow, only be the important one that tells you you're always videos you see, you're privileged. German emails like I am an A list as I'm on as well. as well I just I'm sure you are too, are you just probably more organised than I am okay right this is not now. It's blocked. I can't even unpresent All right,

Antony Mayfield 12:29  
I am gonna let, let's leave this meeting, I will put into the calendar. In a moment, I'll put a teams meeting. Okay, so, refresh your calendar in about 30 seconds. Okay, no problem.

Transcribed by https://otter.ai

Speaker 1 0:00  
At the top you can see there's the home, which has, like, see register upcoming events with Friday AI, there's kind of Friday meetings they have geo side, which is off, obviously generative energy optimization established that a hot topic at GD for like, the last 40 hours or week. We were quoted in recording a piece recently about what Edelman was about his proprietary tool, which is not, I mean, we know it's a partnership, right? They talked about proprietary element tool for clients. It's profound. They use profound. They're calling it proprietary tool. Love it like everybody else, proprietary. It's a partnership. Brilliant. Okay, so he threw this resource here Juki Gallery, and now the foundation GPT, which you know about this haven't changed the glossary, legal, compliance, Getting Started accessing tools, strategy resources. So open AI is chat, GPT here, element, AI ecosystem, and then copilot resource, if I just click in one sense of duty, gallery. So it goes, explore, air, password, design to enhance efficiency, creativity, strategy. So this is the gallery here that I was struggling with the look the Bible, TPTs, click, click, click, so many clicks. Then here's I've got a tick tock trans idea generator. I'm happy to just let me know if you want me to click. And I mean, which you could play around with it. So

Speaker 2 1:22  
each of those are power points with explanations of the GPT in that you can

Speaker 1 1:26  
Yes, the GPT. So you can imagine how many layers there are here. Click this, tick, tock, trends. Here we go. Here's the generator. And then I can click here for the even can't click it, I can't click it.

Speaker 2 1:36  
Yeah, right. Click. And then highlight your weight. Presentation Mode, okay,

Speaker 1 1:40  
right, okay, but division mode, okay, great. It's really, really unbelievable, right? Welcome. Am I going out? Right? Have a good answer to get back to

Speaker 2 1:55  
the Oh, stop sharing the right at the top.

Unknown Speaker 2:02  
No shit.

Unknown Speaker 2:04  
Back, try back again. I've not tried that.

Unknown Speaker 2:07  
I know right, Nightmare,

Antony Mayfield 2:13  
I don't know. Okay, so let's not use that.

Unknown Speaker 2:17  
Yeah, can we get out of this thing now?

Antony Mayfield 2:22  
I What's that little that little thing is that little top left button with the man on the screen. Oh, here. Yeah,

Speaker 1 2:39  
yeah, okay, okay. Let's share again, but let me find the window I had. Here we go. So I'm gonna go back to this. Okay, re sharing. That was so easy. Okay, so, okay, that would back hit the hub, top bar to ease DJ element AI, which would be DJ, AI compliance, getting started, AI ambassadors, whoever. This Ambassador programme, which we haven't implemented here yet, and the AI advisory, as you know, it's all consulting stuff. What are the geo so check this, your site, clinic, I just see what it is elements and it was offering, why did you mention DJ for this stuff by the Antony? It just really pisses us off. We always told this, like, this is like, you know?

Antony Mayfield 3:30  
Why? Why you always told what

Speaker 1 3:32  
that was meant to be? Dje branded everything not Edelman, just makes us feel like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, excluded. So join jump to complete. So the look at the AI like, oh, here we go. Virtual. This is a little bit better in terms of type of content. Case study, audience, internal offering, Okay, why

Antony Mayfield 3:55  
don't we do these? Why don't we, like, kind of imagine a user story and try and do the user story like, Yeah, so one of your users you want to get, they want to, like, do pitch research on a new client, or they're looking for, they're looking for bots that will help them put together a campaign plan for, like, training a sports shoe company or something like that.

Speaker 1 4:23  
Yeah. So I think, I think so. I think for us, let me think about the categories. For me, it's things like, there's energy with our media, which would be media list creation, you know, media landscape specialist writing. So there's that function of, like, media relations in the world. Then there would be one, for example, for strategy planning. So it'd be like, Audience Insights, many audiences, culture like stuff that we do, culture prediction, like stuff we've got. Then there's things like, there's things that weird space, for example, like when we create GPT that mimic the voice of a CEO, for example, that we use for content writing or to, you know, that kind of thing, executive, brand, executive and brand voice. So for me, it's like, it's like, look at all the different types of things that we have, then thinking about where we categorise it. I think that's the journey, for me, is like, by function, by function learning, right? So data intelligence had its own function around. And I think it's some would be like, Is it, is them again, just prints out as ideas. Or some of them, like, open to everyone to use, or some kind of, like, restricted, meaning, you know that there, but you need assistance to use them. So that's a good idea. I do like the idea, yeah, because they said that one maybe, is this tagged, where it's, like, we have the capability or the tool, but you can't just go away and do like. I just worried people do like about analytics,

Speaker 2 5:44  
stuff you're already doing, like meat monitoring with, yeah, not even search turned on. So it's,

Unknown Speaker 5:52  
well, yeah, sorry, even the front lines of the design.

Antony Mayfield 5:56  
No, no. I mean, I spent, I spent a whole, I spent a whole workshop with a marketing team not being able to persuade them, because this is like group think on a call, like not being able to persuade them that you couldn't that chat GPT couldn't see the link that they were pasting in of that to their own website and their own copy, and it was going, Oh, look, it's picked out these words that that are possibly not on brand for us, and it's Good, yeah, none of those words are on your website because it can't read the link. It's hallucinating. But anyway, so I've got it, I got a taxonomy for you, which I can send over that I just kind of put together quickly on this kind of stuff, and we could build that up. But really, the the process to go through is like, it's almost like a product process. So it's start with, start with a vision. Use your stories. It sounds onerous, but it's not. We've I'll show you a dashboard that we put together for we did a we did our innovation workshop yesterday, and we put the whole team through building product. Let me just show you.

Speaker 2 7:07  
The challenge that we also have Antony is that we, because we're Microsoft shop, I think we have to use SharePoint.

Speaker 1 7:14  
I would you say, like over time, it's supposed to be different, but if we now, you rise. Well,

Antony Mayfield 7:21  
yeah, but it's not, but, I mean, we can do a better job than than that Edelman website, because that's been, just been, I mean, even if it's just one web page with a bunch of pages, or even if it's a Google Doc that people can download, right? So, I mean, I'd run you through a couple of these ideas, because one of the things, one thing that we've done is like, develop a chat GPT Guide, which we update every week, and then we embed that in in a GPT. So why don't we put the knowledge that you want to share into a GPT on your system? So yes, you put you do a custom, custom chat bot, and then nobody has to go to SharePoint. They can just say, What do I do if I'm doing a campaign? I mean, you know, doing research for campaign this, what's a good prompt for x? Well, try this, and we can put the caveats in there that you shouldn't trust the outputs of a GPT. You need to think about this clearly, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2 8:24  
Would that be, would you use the the the new API that would connect, like, would they be able to do all of the work in that GPT, or would it just link off to other GPT? They

Antony Mayfield 8:34  
would tell them what to do, to go and do the work. I mean, it could link to other gpts. Yes. Well, why not in the results? So, like,

Speaker 1 8:41  
I like that, yes, that's a bit more put us types, yeah, communications, people, I think that's actually makes more sense. It's a

Antony Mayfield 8:47  
lot it's a lot calmer, isn't it, yeah. And also it's like, sorry. But the the irony of all of that Edelman content, which I would just, you know, if I were them, I would just download and put into a bot and then give everyone the bot. Because why? Why does anyone need to go to SharePoint?

Unknown Speaker 9:08  
I mean, I mean, the one thing I would

Speaker 1 9:11  
say not, they're not, not visualised well at all. But I like the idea of, like, what is it that, like, they have a starting point? Like, what do I have to work on? So here's the, here's the first place like, I wouldn't know to say Tiktok transporter,

Antony Mayfield 9:24  
yeah, but Thomas, to get round, to get round the get right. Let's just imagine we never go near SharePoint again, because nobody does. But let's, let's just say, Okay, we give everyone a Word document with everything in it that they can search, and also, and also a GPT. And what we do to update it, we just send out a new one every week.

Unknown Speaker 9:47  
PDF, pretty nice.

Antony Mayfield 9:52  
But the point is, is just like, it's up to date. Everyone's got it. It's easy, like, so there's a little bit of editorial in the background, but there's not a huge there's not a huge project to build a website which we don't need.

Speaker 1 10:07  
Can I then building on that? Could there be, could that be and see the kind of, like, access all areas thing kind of naturalised? I mean, they're kind of like, let's call it our foundation. Let's say so your basic toolkit everyone has access to use LGBT. And then do we have, like, more specialists, yes, tools that have more restricted access. Then they could come to you or to me or to someone in the team and say, Look, I'm over this project. And we can better. It makes sense to use directly, or to say them, you can use it, but work with me to my team to help do that as to know you. So when I think you should that, for me is, I feel like they're developing a democratic here's like 80 you can use navigate lot or hundreds, and then, and then, here's, like, the things that we'll show you what's possible, but you don't have access to them, right? I didn't know we could tell you I like that, or, or,

Speaker 2 10:55  
or reach out to reach out to us, to help us. Yes, so that we can help you build Yes, what you need.

Antony Mayfield 11:00  
I mean, another way of, kind of looking at it at a low level, let's not get carried away. But, I mean, until you want to get carried away, but like is, you treat it like an editorial thing, as in, like, you know, here's us explaining, you know, you explaining it to everyone. Here's the document, here's the GPT. And then each week, you're sort of saying, look, here's the thing of the week that you can try out. It's a newsletter, isn't it? But, but if you do it well, if you do it well and try not to throw everything at people and make it boring, then people will actually enjoy it, and they'll probably read it every week. It's

Speaker 1 11:37  
a good idea, because then could be a team's channel. I think it could be, you could deliver it by the team's channel. I still think it's a good time the team channel, and you maybe have the layers. And then it's like, here the three new ones this week. It has a new sign. And it's like, oh, wow, that's new. I can think about it's clickable, right? Yeah, there's still a repository somewhere on SharePoint. I hate to say that's like these that we keep updating. Here's the hundreds everyone has access to when you can search, even if you logged in there, oh yeah. I mean that that we have, but you can't, like, just mean, it's good for you to know we have a capability, but that's actually really straightforward access. You know what's

Speaker 2 12:13  
interesting also, when you go to the when you go to our enterprise, when you first log in, our gpts Don't show up. They don't know it's only Edelman gpts. So you can look for it, but you don't, but people don't know what to look so I think, I don't know if there's a way that we can change that experience, considering it's one enterprise account with dje, but when you first log in, it's all Edelman, yes, the

Unknown Speaker 12:37  
foundation, yeah.

Antony Mayfield 12:38  
So, I mean, like, I think that's like a thing where there's two sides there. One is like, we can have our own page where you've got your hall of fame, or your top 10 Xeno ones and the rest of the guide, but in the meantime, it's like, yeah, you've got to, we've got to get onto them and say you need an instance that's for Zeno with the Zeno ones up front, because this is not going to encourage people to use it. It doesn't look good to clients as well when we're demonstrating it, etc,

Unknown Speaker 13:10  
etc. I mean,

Antony Mayfield 13:13  
it's possible. It is it, you know, it is possible they just have someone would just have to talk to chat GPT and sort it out. But, you know, I doubt that. I doubt that Edelman is on such an amazing deal that that they couldn't have a different instance. That's for Zeno as well.

Speaker 1 13:31  
Yeah, really, they can't. I mean, I like the idea of it, but I think this model of like, I like this idea of the chat GPT to help at least identify what our base size are going to be, what salaries are for the organisation. For now, we can delve into it, and then having a weekly update of like this, all you have access to, and here's new ones of the week, whatever.

Antony Mayfield 13:55  
So do, do people use teams channels.

Unknown Speaker 14:02  
They do, yeah, there's a lot of teams channels, yeah,

Antony Mayfield 14:04  
yeah. I mean, it's the same. I'm just checking, because sometimes people only only use the ones that have to do with their team, or whatever. It's really good

Speaker 1 14:11  
at using it. Like, you know what? Extra stretch and planning, while they have a trip on that, they're always on sharing trends they're finding every day. Like, well, today, that's editorial,

Antony Mayfield 14:18  
isn't it? I mean, it's like, if you could get, if you could get, if we can get something going like that with the knowledge sharing on on AI, if you don't, you know. I mean, I don't want to teach us our own trades, but if we, we put, like, some super useful gpts on it, people start sharing them and talking about the channel, and then it'll take off. I think. So,

Unknown Speaker 14:39  
really engagement for starters,

Antony Mayfield 14:42  
and like, so, you know, you can put your little we can put little videos on there, of demos of things like little loom videos, or whatever you're allowed to use. But, like, looms really good. Have you used it?

Unknown Speaker 14:54  
I use, um, teller, oh, is it?

Antony Mayfield 14:56  
Yeah, same sort of thing. Probably, yeah. But it's just, it's so easy. It's like,

Unknown Speaker 15:01  
we allowed to use that DJ? I don't know,

Unknown Speaker 15:02  
but it works. Oh, my God, I don't know. I can record my screen, basically,

Antony Mayfield 15:12  
so, like, looms, like, just, it's so easy. It's like, just really, really quick. You do your screen, you can do your bit of your screen, you can add in some bits. It cuts out all the ums and ahs, and then you just send a link to people. Yeah, I'll send you some

Speaker 1 15:28  
Look at this. What does that mean? What did you click on? I just clicked that. Wait,

Antony Mayfield 15:33  
my tip. You made my screen go purple. Oh, did I Yeah, it's got a box around it. Now, I don't know why. That's

Speaker 1 15:41  
really weird, that I just weird. I just how it is that and access which

Speaker 2 15:48  
link was it? I did this. The middle one, dje, proprietary tools. Oh, because we're, yeah,

Antony Mayfield 15:56  
they're listening. They're listening. Have

Speaker 1 15:58  
you got this link to what? Let me just send this to homework so you can just have a look. Sorry, I just, I want to chat. I just press the tab as well as actually before, for the for the DJ proprietary tools. It's how many to request access for it. Just see, see that, yeah, the tab is the DJ price at all one. I thought I was showing that before you got there. Register. Weird thing. Okay, um, Andy, so I know I just, I know we're over really, so, really quick, please. In terms of next steps, I've ever been with an idea to do, I want to find out from you, like I from you, like, if we max out on a currently or not within hours to do this, like a mini additional scoping, just to, like, workshop, some of this for now and then we do, like, a complete crazy build, honestly, based on that, he has really good ideas, maybe different platforms.

Antony Mayfield 16:57  
Oh, we don't need to do builds. We just need to do we need to, like, work out what it is we're going to communicate, you know what? I mean,

Speaker 1 17:03  
yeah, we and how we organise it. So, I mean, is that possible? Who else could we have, and you've got so much of players, or do I like how? I mean, kind of like, this is gonna be awesome. Basically, this

Unknown Speaker 17:14  
point, what we did, I can be your point for this. I can

Speaker 1 17:16  
be your point. And then they have this design, this thing. And I would, I would love, I know this is like, can we not be too aggressive, but can we, like, introduce a new fiscal, like the initial just at least where this looks like, I would

Unknown Speaker 17:27  
think so. I mean, that's six office School

Antony Mayfield 17:29  
is on July, July 1.

Speaker 1 17:32  
We have a fiscal New Year, Antony, which happens the week before, usually, like, the 20/34 of June, or something. I think this year Bobby has, like, it would be a really nice moment to say, it would be we have, we've global opportunity for us to start to shed it has been completely populated, but we just start to have, like, the categories and whatever, and then the GPT, this initiative. I don't know how we think about this, but if you can think about Antony like now until the end of June, what does that look like to get this up and running, just like this initial stab at it, and then we can keep refining it.

Antony Mayfield 18:06  
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I guess what we just need to be clear on is, is, what would you like us? What is it would you like us to design

Speaker 2 18:16  
consulting and logistics. Design consulting. It's the mechanics. Mechanics. I mean,

Speaker 1 18:21  
designer, like, like, just, it's also, yeah, how it works. Like, what makes it be decided is more functional? What does that look like? Um, but maybe on the chicken side, you need some help with, uh, building this.

Speaker 2 18:32  
Well, I would, I would love your thoughts on if, if we do put, if we build the knowledge base of all of our gpts in a bot, I would just, I, I might need some help with the with the, I guess, the custom instructions on, on, you know, and which means, I think we need to the taxonomy of the different gpts that we have. So I think there's, there's a lot of parallel paths that we take, but like, yeah, documenting all of our GPT, linking to them, describing what they are and what they do, and then at that point, when we plug it into GPT, I would love your help just on the user interaction, yeah. So what is the right way that? What is some when somebody gets to this, what are they going to ask and then what is the GPT going to respond back with, yeah,

Antony Mayfield 19:14  
okay. Do you want me to do a quick, like, outline of the approach on that? Yes. And do you want a proposal for like, extra hours on that? Yes, please. Yeah, okay.

Speaker 1 19:24  
And then also, you just folded, like, copyright the communications pieces? Oh, yeah, no.

Antony Mayfield 19:29  
I think it's like, the way to do this, the way to do the way to do knowledge management, is editorial, is what I'm saying, because a system is not going to cut it. It's a way of, like, How are you engaging with people? So there's so so Brito, you've got all the data. We've got the eight. We've got no shortage of data. It's all just about like, Okay, how do we organise it, and then how do we communicate it in useful bursts to people that go across channels and email and and point and point to a SharePoint page. And that's that's probably the sort of thing. But the process to do that, and we can workshop it really, really quickly, is to do it like a mini product sprint. You just go, okay, what are the user stories? What's happening when someone's looking for something, what's our vision for it? And then, like, Okay, so what's the product requirements they did? But it all happens faster than you think. It's just having the discipline of going through those steps. So and then we'll get, we'll get to, effectively, we get to, you know, a beta or an MVP, which is like, let's do a series of four newsletters or four things where we're showcasing bits. We've got a section of it here, and we've got a roadmap for what we build out when it works, if it works, when we when we understand what people's feedback is, and we can measure it.

Speaker 1 20:45  
Yeah, if you're able to put that thing together, that'd be great. Antony, and then we can get rolling on this. I think it's so critical. I think we just alright. But yeah,

Antony Mayfield 20:56  
yeah, we've got all we've got all the stuff and the thoughts and the models for this. So I'll put it together like and and send it right back to you. Thank you for the call to make it really, really clear. The other thing is, I'll just throw in quickly. I know we're over time, but is if it's possible at all to get, like, a contractor login for for your email or whatever, so that we can go on to your chat GPT and have an instance there, that's going to make it a lot easier for us to,

Speaker 1 21:27  
yeah, I'll look into it, yeah, Tony and stuff you see, yeah, I'll

Speaker 2 21:31  
look into it, yeah. Or, you know, whatever, giving you access it would be much easier. Would be, yeah, because we can build you, like, a little

Antony Mayfield 21:37  
demo one look. Here's the thing we've learned over the last, like, we always knew, but we've really learned over the last couple of months with five coding is, like, it's so much easier to build it and show it to each other than it is to put it in a plan. You know, you know, it's kind of this, oh yeah, no, I get that. Yeah. Everything comes alive and moves so much faster. But also it's like, if we've got, if we've got access on there, then we can, like, have a quick look at a bot and help fix it. Or we can set up a, you know, a GPT bot on when

Speaker 2 22:09  
we log into our GPT, we do it through SSO, if, which means that, which means that the way that we access our our gpts is through. SSO, yeah, oh, sure. So it just passes the credentials through, which means they would need, I don't know if they would need, a laptop.

Unknown Speaker 22:28  
Oh, I see you know what I mean, yeah, because it would

Speaker 2 22:30  
have to be imaged for dje, the actual laptop.

Antony Mayfield 22:37  
Yeah, I mean someone, someone, somewhere, must. Yeah,

Speaker 1 22:42  
we're happy with that. Out to it. Yeah, from London office is fine. Yeah, let's

Antony Mayfield 22:47  
get Sarah to bring one down. She's probably

Unknown Speaker 22:55  
got to brilliant.

Antony Mayfield 22:59  
Okay, so other stuff. And you know, Jason's talking to Gaurav on David Leanne's team tomorrow, the head of data in Asia is talking to you tomorrow as well. Brito, isn't he? Yeah, great. And we've got, we've got an, I've got an, did I get you the outline of slides for the you give me that? You give me those. Great, yeah, oh, yeah. And you gave me the

Speaker 1 23:23  
feedback. One any from you, Anthony, is this the AI leadership? Like, just what you're thinking? Just, yeah, yeah. And I sent you some data options. I think I went on the New York one down, pressing dates with you, for Canada, Chicago, and then the west coast as well. Yeah, no,

Antony Mayfield 23:40  
that's, that's, that's really straightforward to get that together. I just really wanted those other things out the door first, and also the hive. I've got the hive proposal now, so I'll get that over, but I'll get this over first, and then the exec edge, and then that. Great, so many things. But you know, thank you. We're enjoying it. Take care, guys.
