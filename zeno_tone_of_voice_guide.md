✍️ Zeno Group: Tone of Voice & Style Guide
For prototype writing, interface copy, headlines & narrative UX

🔊 Brand Voice Overview
Zeno’s tone is clear, bold and human — underpinned by a values-led belief system and an appetite for action. The voice strikes a balance between confident assertion and inclusive warmth, designed to inspire and energise while remaining grounded in clarity.
It reads like a brand that:
Believes in people


Communicates plainly and directly


Enjoys stretching the limits of imagination


Values emotional intelligence as much as strategic smarts



🎯 Core Style Principles
Principle
Description
Fearlessly Positive
Speak with conviction. Zeno is bold, but never brash. Avoid fluff — say what you mean.
Human First
Conversational, not corporate. Use contractions. Avoid jargon. Prioritise clarity.
Purpose-Led
Messaging should often reflect values, impact or mission without becoming preachy.
Energetic, Not Overhyped
Momentum is important, but the tone avoids exclamation marks and buzzword inflation.
Clever Over Cute
Use smart, compelling language — not puns or quirkiness unless very strategic.
